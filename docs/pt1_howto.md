## Introduction

- [Who is the target audience of this talk?](#target-audience)
- [What are the key assumptions made for this talk?](#assumptions)
- [Who are we?](#who-are-we)
- [Environment setup](#environment-setup)

---

### Target audience

In order to follow along we assume that you:

1. Basic experience writing code or data (JSON, XML, YAML) in text editors
1. Understanding of security requirements for your business or mission
1. Understanding of your system and the larger context of your projects


---

### But I'm not the target audience!

We also assume you may not have these experiences.

* "But I've never been a developer!"
* "But I've never been an assessor!"
* "But I've never done governance, risk, or compliance work at my job!"

---

### But I'm not the target audience! (continued)

That is OK, we are very happy you're here!

* Somewhere, somehow, you are a member of an organization.
* In that organization, you are part of an information security program. 

---

### But I'm not the target audience! (continued)

That is OK, we are very happy you're here!

* In the present or future, you will use compliance and security tools that use OSCAL.
* Shared specifications may standardize information and behavior for multiple tools from different vendors.
* Changed tools and processes will impact your organization and work.

1. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) if on macOS or Windows, [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) if on Linux

üìù You do not have to follow along to learn from this presentation.

---

### Assumptions

<!-- _class: workshop invert radialbg -->

The goal of this presentation is to demonstrate *a* workflow showcasing how OSCAL and a GRC service *could* interact within your organization.

---

### Who are we?

<!-- TODO include some icons here -->

* Developer - Developing the application
* System Engineer - Deploying and maintaining the application in the system

---

## The opening act (why are we here?)

Our fictional organization, IFA, wants the GoodRead product team to use OSCAL on this new project and report back on how it improves the project lifecycle.

![IFA's GitHub page](./support/screenshot_ifa_github.png)

We have been tasked with designing and documenting this new system.

---

### The project

- Important Federal Agency needs a link shortener (let's call it **IFA GoodRead**)
- How will it work?
    - Staff log into GoodRead admin portal
    - Take a URL like `https://www.ifa.gov/2023/04/19/request-for-comment-on-new-guidance-for-2023-fiscal-year`
    - Generate a short link like `https://from.ifa.gov/2023rfc`
    - Share short link with public
    - Track audience metric from short link usage

---

## The valley of despair

- IFA has lots of mandatory policies and recommended processes
- Projects must start, change, or stop through the IFA SDLC
- Not just developers and engineers create and manage a system:
    - Technical and non-technical staff must frequently collaborate
    - They write about what they have and do in the project
    - They have to keep documentation current in long SDLC phases

---

## The valley of despair (continued)

* How did they do it before?
    - Staff created Microsoft Word and PDF documents
    - Colleagues reviewed individually, made comments, emailed draft feedback
    - Frequent meetings occurred to clear up ambiguities in documents
* Why didn't they like it before?
    - Data was unstructured and hard to manage
    - Quality checking across multiple related documents was labor intensive
    - Quick spot check of system development or operation difficult

---

## The valley of despair (continued)

IFA staff were not so happy.

---


## Leaving the valley of despair (continued)

* How will the IFA GoodRead Team do now?
    - They built a GRC program with a centralized service
    - Staff use web application or APIs
    - Little reliance on Microsoft Word or PDF documents
* What does the IFA CISO office expect to happen now?
    - GRC service has structured data for efficient analysis
    - Most quality checking is done by GRC
    - GRC indicates status or progress on the system lifecyle

---

## The valley of despair (continued)

IFA staff are a little happier now.

---

## How could we leverage OSCAL as developers?

Although *each organization will use OSCAL differently*, it provides some key benefits:

- Developers can document systems with code, with all the benefits of modularization.
- GRC tools and services can exchange data with standard data models.
- Vendors can provide security information about their products in components.

<!--
TODO: Create the following slides:
How do those roles collaborate with OSCAL? (*a* way they interact, this is not prescriptive)
    1. Developers write SSP store in VCS (GitHub)
    1. VCS copy of SSP uploaded to GRC tool
    1. ISSM reviews in GRC tool
    1. During assessment, assessors send AP to AO/ISSM/developer
    1. Devs submit evidence to assessors in AR against AP in GRC tool
-->

---

## Let's try OSCAL

*A potential* OSCAL workflow framed within a *SDLC process*: 

1. **Prepare** the project and its system
1. **Categorize** the system's data
1. **Select** controls for the system
1. **Implement** the system and its security
1. **Assess** system's security
1. **Authorize** the system for operation
1. **Monitor** the system

<!--
5. A new hope (let's try OSCAL) (the bulk of the presentation)
    1. Setup (write metadata with name, party, contact info)
    1. Introduce the application (link shortener)
    2. Describe the system (deployment)
    1.Pick the controls
        * Retrieve a list of controls from our ITSO (from GRC Tool manager for ITSO's office)
        * Perform profile resolution and retrieve derived catalog
        * Compare the output resolved catalog (describe the utility)
    1. Describe the system
        * Review the system (what controlled by who)
        * Perform validation
    1. Write about the system in the SSP
        * Introduce automation with GHA?
    1. Assess the system in the SSP, GRC drops AR
    1. Devs review AR and create POA&M
    1. GRC tool checks POA&M and AR for updates
6. Conclusion (bring back the word document, compare the benefits)
-->

---

## Let's try OSCAL (continued)

1. **Prepare** the project and its system
    * Bootstrap OSCAL files with preparatory info
2. **Categorize** the system's data
    * Add system information types in OSCAL SSP
    * Add system categorization in OSCAL SSP

---

## Let's try OSCAL (continued)

3. **Select** controls for the system
    * Retrieve import profile for OSCAL SSP to identify selected controls
    * Generate resolved OSCAL catalog from OSCAL profile
4. **Implement** the system and its security
    * Add "this system" component in OSCAL SSP
    * Add control implementation in OSCAL
---

## Let's try OSCAL (continued)

5. **Assess** system's security
    * Retrieve OSCAL AP
    * Perform assessment activities in OSCAL AP
    * Create OSCAL AR documenting assessment activities, supporting evidence, and results
    * Upload OSCAL AR to GRC
    * Create OSCAL POA&M and upload to GRC
6. **Authorize** the system for operation
    * Retrieve updated OSCAL SSP with authorization data
    * Deploy system

---

## Let's try OSCAL (continued)

7. **Monitor** the system
    * Review OSCAL POA&M and check if findings obsolete
    * Retrieve OSCAL AP for continuous monitoring steps
    * Perform continuous monitoring activities
    * Create OSCAL AR documenting activities, supporting evidence, and results
    * Create and update OSCAL POA&M if needed

### OSCAL basics

OSCAL describes a set of *models* for documenting a system in machine readable formats (JSON, XML, YAML).

![oscal layers](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/concepts/layer/oscal-layers.svg)

<!--
_footer: "![width:60px](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/NIST_logo.svg) How do I OSCAL? - 4th Annual OSCAL Conference Workshop"
_class: workshop whitebg
-->

#### How do we edit OSCAL content?

![bg right 100%](./support/screenshot_model_reference.png)

- Refer to the [OSCAL model documentation](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/reference/latest/complete/) (pictured)
- Configure your editor to use OSCAL's [JSON/YAML](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/tree/d3a2b990e24210c253642451e30ea6db99bd045b/json/schema) and [XML](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/tree/d3a2b990e24210c253642451e30ea6db99bd045b/xml/schema) **schemas**.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è OSCAL imposes additional constraints not represented within the schemas.

#### Leveraging OSCAL tooling

OSCAL tools, such as the [OSCAL-CLI](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-cli), provide additional functionality:

- Converting documents between formats (JSON, YAML, XML)
    ```
    $ oscal-cli profile convert basic-profile.json basic-profile.xml
    ```

- Validating OSCAL documents
    ```
    $ oscal-cli profile validate basic-profile.json
    ```

- Performing specific OSCAL operations (profile resolution)
    ```
    $ oscal-cli profile resolve basic-profile.json
    ```

#### ü§ñ Opportunity for automation

<!--
The astute among you may be thinking: "I could generate evidence for assessment results in CI/CD pretty easily."

We agree! In a separate presentation we have explored this idea with a small GitHub actions workflow that generated assessment results automatically.

### Appendix A.i: Our starter SSP's roles and parties

We use `<role>` and `<party>` in `<metadata>` to document the kinds of work in a project, the people who do it, and the organization they work for.


```xml

### Appendix A.iii: Our starter SSP's system information types

In `<system-information>` we document the information types (as defined in [FIPS-199](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.199.pdf)) present in the system.

```xml
...

### Appendix A.iv: Our starter SSP (conclusion)

In this demonstration we have:
- Created a minimal SSP in OSCAL
- Discussed the `<metadata>` object
- Documented our system's `roles` and `parties`
- Documented the information types in our system and their categorization

‚ö†Ô∏è The SSP in its current state is invalid! We must fill it out with information given in later steps.
