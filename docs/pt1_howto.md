    2. Describe the system (deployment)

4. A new hope (let's try OSCAL) (the bulk of the presentation)
    1. Start with the controls
        * We get a list of controls from our ITSO
        * Create a basic profile
        * Perform profile resolution
        * Compare the output resolved catalog (describe the utility)
    2. Describe the system
        * Review the system (what controlled by who)
        * Perform validation
    3. Write the SSP
        * Introduce automation with GHA?
