                    <p>For the RedHat Linux servers upon which the IFA applications are deployed only the system engineer has a non-privileged user to log in remotely via the SSH protocol to perform ad-hoc inspection, monthly log review as required by policy and procedure, and emergency debugging of the system. Privileged system administration operations may only be performed with the <code>sudo</code> subsystem which requires a password, two-factor authentication, and has enhanced logging of all commands executed. The system engineer must log in remotely and then use <code>sudo</code> to elevate privileges. Remote access with the privileged account is prohibited by configuration and attempts are logged.</p>
